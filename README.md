# WildernessEncounterSim
Simulator for wilderness encounters in OD&D.

Randomly rolls encounters using OD&D (LBB) Vol-3 tables, and reports total EHD (Equivalent Hit Dice) for each. Uses data for EHD produced by the Arena/MonsterMetrics simulator, and documented in the OED Monster Database (http://www.oedgames.com/addons/houserules/index.html).

Specify desired terrain on command-line; output is a thousand encounter EHD values, for external statistical processing.

# Python version
In the python/notebooks folder there is a jupyter notebook implementing this.  It will randomly select a terrain, otherwise set the one you want.
